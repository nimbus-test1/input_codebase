1. Create a new directory for your Terraform project and navigate into it.
   ```bash
   mkdir terraform-aws-web-server
   cd terraform-aws-web-server
   ```

2. Create a Terraform configuration file, for example `main.tf`, and paste the Terraform configuration content provided above.

3. Initialize Terraform to download the required providers.
   ```bash
   terraform init
   ```

4. Create a `terraform.tfvars` file to define the value of the `key_name` variable.
   ```hcl
   key_name = "your-key-pair-name"
   ```

5. Apply the Terraform configuration to provision the resources.
   ```bash
   terraform apply
   ```

6. Confirm the apply step by typing `yes` when prompted.

7. Once the provisioning is complete, you can access the web server using the Elastic IP assigned to it. You can find the Elastic IP in the Terraform output or in the AWS Management Console.
