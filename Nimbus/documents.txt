1. Ensure you have AWS CLI and Terraform installed on your machine.
2. Configure your AWS CLI with the necessary credentials using `aws configure`.
3. Save the YAML configuration content to a file named `config.yml`.
4. Save the Terraform configuration content to a file named `main.tf`.
5. Initialize the Terraform configuration by running `terraform init` in the directory containing `main.tf`.
6. Apply the Terraform configuration by running `terraform apply`. This will create the necessary AWS resources as described in the files.
7. Verify the creation of resources in the AWS Management Console. You should see an EC2 instance with an associated Elastic IP and a security group allowing SSH and HTTP traffic.

Note: Modify the variable values in `config.yml` and `main.tf` as needed to match your AWS setup and requirements.
