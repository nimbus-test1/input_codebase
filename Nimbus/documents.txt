1. **Setup AWS credentials**: Ensure your GitHub repository has AWS credentials set up in the secrets. You need to add `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` to your GitHub repository secrets.

2. **Push changes**: Commit and push changes to the `main` branch to trigger the workflow.

3. **Review Terraform plan**: The workflow will run `terraform plan` to create an execution plan and will proceed to apply the plan if it is on the `main` branch.

4. **Monitor deployment**: Check the GitHub Actions tab in your repository to monitor the deployment process and ensure everything runs smoothly.

5. **Modify Terraform configuration**: Update the `main.tf` file as needed and push changes to the `main` branch to deploy updates to your infrastructure.
