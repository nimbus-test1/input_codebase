## Steps to use the files:

1. **YAML Configuration**:
    - This YAML configuration describes the setup for an AWS EC2 instance that will run on Ubuntu, allowing HTTP and SSH traffic, and attaching an Elastic IP.
    - Save the YAML configuration content in a file named `aws_web_server.yml`.

2. **Terraform Configuration**:
    - This HCL (HashiCorp Configuration Language) script sets up the same AWS EC2 instance, security group, and Elastic IP.
    - Save the HCL configuration content in a file named `main.tf`.

3. **Deploying the Resources**:
    - **Using YAML**:
        1. Ensure you have the AWS CLI and necessary permissions configured.
        2. Run the following command to deploy the resources defined in the `aws_web_server.yml` file:
           ```bash
           aws cloudformation create-stack --stack-name my-web-server-stack --template-body file://aws_web_server.yml
           ```

    - **Using Terraform**:
        1. Ensure you have Terraform installed and configured.
        2. Initialize the Terraform configuration:
           ```bash
           terraform init
           ```
        3. Apply the Terraform configuration:
           ```bash
           terraform apply
           ```
        4. Confirm the apply step by typing `yes` when prompted.

4. **Accessing the Web Server**:
    - Once the resources are deployed, you can access your web server via its Elastic IP address, which will be assigned and available in your AWS console or output by Terraform.

5. **Cleanup**:
    - To remove the stack using AWS CLI, run:
      ```bash
      aws cloudformation delete-stack --stack-name my-web-server-stack
      ```
    - To destroy the resources using Terraform, run:
      ```bash
      terraform destroy
      ```
      Confirm the destroy step by typing `yes` when prompted.
