1. **Setup GitHub Secrets:**
   - Go to your repository on GitHub.
   - Navigate to `Settings` > `Secrets`.
   - Add the following secrets:
     - `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`
     - `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`

2. **Commit and Push:**
   - Ensure your Terraform configuration files are in the root directory of your repository.
   - Commit and push your changes to the `main` branch.

3. **Trigger Workflow:**
   - The GitHub Actions workflow is configured to run on any push or pull request to the `main` branch.
   - Verify that the workflow runs and successfully deploys the infrastructure.

4. **Verify Deployment:**
   - Check the AWS Console to ensure the resources (e.g., S3 bucket) have been created.
   - Review the outputs in the GitHub Actions logs to see the Terraform outputs, such as the S3 bucket name.
