1. **Set Up AWS Credentials**:
   Ensure your AWS credentials are set up in GitHub Secrets. You will need `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`.

2. **GitHub Repository**:
   - Create or use an existing GitHub repository.
   - Add the above YAML file as `.github/workflows/terraform-deploy.yml`.
   - Add the above Terraform file as `main.tf` in the root directory of your repository.

3. **Push to GitHub**:
   - Commit and push your changes to the `main` branch of your GitHub repository.

4. **Monitor Workflow**:
   - Navigate to the "Actions" tab in your GitHub repository to monitor the deployment workflow.

5. **Verify Deployment**:
   - Once the workflow completes, verify the deployed infrastructure on AWS.
   - Check the `instance_ip` output to get the public IP of the deployed EC2 instance.

This setup will automatically deploy Terraform infrastructure to AWS whenever changes are pushed to the `main` branch.
